                            <div class="ui text fluid container">
                                <p>I am an experienced engineering manager with more than 16 years in software engineering and a background in development. I have worked for two companies in two different industries over that period - <a href="https://www.openbet.com/">OpenBet Technologies</a> and <a href="https://www.skygroup.sky/">Sky Plc</a>. I take pride in delivering software solutions end to end while using good engineering practices and also importantly progressing the skill and careers of the people I have managed.

                                <p>At OpenBet I started as a full stack Software Developer and progressed through a range of roles, moving to Senior Developer and Technical Lead and finally to Development Manager. I led teams delivering front-end websites and back-end sportsbook trading, gaming and account management software for many of OpenBet’s biggest clients such as Coral, Betfair, Rank and Tote to mention a few.</p>

                                <p>I managed teams split across different OpenBet sites - London, Athens and Romania. I also worked onsite at a new client’s Canadian office for the duration of a project, in New Brunswick, Canada, leading a team in the development and rollout of a new front-end sportsbook, retail integration and back-end trading solution for Atlantic Lottery.</p>

                                <p>At Sky I held engineering managerial roles in a few different teams building and maintaining back end broadcast software. Different internal Sky user groups in the areas of Rights, Planning, Scheduling, Content Curation and Presentation use this software to setup the programming for the linear tv schedules, on-demand and streaming for traditional set top box customers as well as the OTT (Over The Top) devices like mobile and tablets for the Sky and NowTV customers to consume.</p>

                                <p>I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science (1st Class Honours) and an MSc in Multimedia from University College Cork.</p>

                                        <p>I was originally brought into the department I joined Sky with, to help establish a good culture and develop good engineering practices through Agile ways of working. This was done by leading by example and embedding some of the good engineering practices I learned at OpenBet, taking line management and career progression of employees seriously and changing the mind-set of the department to be focussed on building the software for the long term through ownership and by placing a priority in non-functional requirements like supportability, performance etc. and not just short term project deadlines.</p>

                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">As Technical Lead, I led a successful delivery and launch of a new Sports Betting website, back-end trading software and retail integration for a new OpenBet Customer in Canada, Atlantic Lottery, all while working with the client from their offices in New Brunswick.  I was involved in the project from the start and responsible for the entire project lifecycle from requirements gathering, solution design, development, testing, training and delivery to production.</div>
                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">As Development Manager, I led a large team and was technically responsible for the Coral Account of up to 40 people distributed in 3 teams across London, Romania and Athens.  As well as delivering new functionality through the year a part of a regular release cycle, Coral had a very successful Grand National from a system performance point of view with their highest peak bets/minute achieved to that point.</div>
                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">At OpenBet I have been involved in and have experience in all stages of the software development life cycle - RFP responses, requirements gathering, analysis, solution design, development, testing, releases, production support, performance monitoring and improvements. Engineers are involved in all these activities and not just restricted to development and engineering managers are responsible for all of these phases for their team/client account.</div>
                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">On the Coral account I helped transition the team from a waterfall methodology to a more Agile way of working by introducing Scrum, having a Coral Product Owner embedded in the team, introducing more regular releases and helped the team become more efficient by having less context switching by splitting the team into distinct functions to allow team to concentrate on priorities from the relevant business owner for that particular business stream – BAU & Production Support, Sprint Feature Development, Analysis, Releases</div>
                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">I developed and built up working relationships with all the clients whose teams I worked on. This was particularly important as a Technical Lead/Development manager where as the technical point of contact for OpenBet for the account there was lots of stakeholder management with senior stakeholders from the client like CTOs, Sportsbook Directors, Senior Project Managers, Steering Boards etc. This was done by being honest, creating good communication lines and building trust with a proven track record of delivering for them over time.</div>
                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">While line managing people in lots of different engineering roles (Developers, Analysts, Testers, Technical Leads, Scrum Masters) through coaching and mentoring, I have helped with their career progression to roles such as Senior Developer, Technical Lead and Development Manager.</div>

This involved collaborating and working closely with client teams and 3rd parties (PMs, Architects, Analysts, Test Leads, Release Managers) in arriving at and building solutions to meet their needs and requirements while still adhering to OpenBet's high technical standards.</div>
                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">Collaborated with other OpenBet Technical leads, Development managers, the CTO and Commercial Account Directors in applying OpenBet company strategy and objectives (commercially and technically) to the team and client account I was managing. From authoring and policing technical standards, promoting code reuse, exchanging ideas and to planning the roll out of new strategic OpenBet products for the commercial success of the account.</div>
                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">Worked on the OpenBet support team for 6 months, supporting all clients live production systems as the first line of support including out of hours. This high pressure environment was a great learning experience with exposure to all the client code bases and different type of client accounts (small and large). It helped focus on what needs doing when building software solutions from a non-functional point of view for resiliency and performance.</div>

                                        <p>After an audit was carried out of all the applications that existed in Sky and their functionality, it was uncovered that there was a lot of duplication and similar functionality being used across the different areas. A new large high-profile programme of work called CSC (Content Supply Chain) was formed to build a new 'best of bread' video content supply chain to support all territories in the UK and Europe and subsequently is to be used in the Group platform for NBCU and Comcast following their acquisition of Sky.</p>
                                        <p>I formed and led a new team to build MAP (Master Acquisition Portal). Its purpose is to manage the physical acquisition of content and metadata (3rd party as well as internal Sky content) into the CSC workflows.</p>

                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">There were no good architecture diagrams or documentation of the existing system (apart from what was in people's heads). We used the 3Cs format for visualising the architecture of the existing system. This allowed us to reason about the existing system and arrive at an approach of how to break up the system - which bits to tackle and which bits to leave alone. As well as using this for our project these diagrams were then used by the rest of the department and expanded upon to illustrate the entire system</div>
                                            <div role="listitem" class="item">The creation of this new VOD Publishing module meant we built a group of 3rd party adaptors for CISCO, VUBIQUITY, etc. The old code base tried to have a shared schema for the XML that was sent to these 3 parties and was them modified for each of them individually by taking out which elements they weren't interested in. We changed the model from an ‘opt out’ to and ‘opt in’ model. So rather than changing all the adaptors every time something new was added and to have to regression test these, it was flipped to only add it to the adaptor that the change was for. This would greatly reduce the impact of changes going forward and reduce the number of modules that would need regression tests changes for each new field that was added.</div>
