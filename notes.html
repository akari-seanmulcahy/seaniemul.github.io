                <h4 class="ui red header">Situation:</h4>
                <p>An old school developer in attitude and skill set, who had a bad reputation competency wise, and from a work ethic point of view, mainly because of the group she hung out with. She was perceived to have been hanging off the coat tails of others and it wasn't clear what her contribution was or if she was a competent developer or not.
                </p>
                <h4 class="ui yellow header">Task:</h4>
                <p>Try and improver he skills and also decide if she was someone we wanted to keep in the team / company.</p>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Action:</h4>
                <p>I gave her a fresh start on a new team that we formed. The team ways of working, was going to be more agile and modern than where she had come from. There was a graduate on this team who had a great attitude and work ethic, although she was young, Ellen set a good example for people like her to realise they had no excuses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                She clearly had to improve her development skills. In 1-1's she acknowledged this and we came up with objectives for her to improve her coding. It was clear from talking to her that she lacked confidence. We came up with ways she could contribute to the new team outside of coding. She had the most domain knowledge and she could step up and take more ownerships of task.  </p>
                <p>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                She started to embrace the news ways of working. She had the domain knowledge and was able to help get the team get up to speed and also help break down the tasks from an analysis stand point She also took ownership of her tasks and started to deliver. Over time by pairing with the stronger developers in the team she started to improve her coding. Since then she has been seen to taking the lead on the teams she has been on since.

                <p> OpenBet did some pretty cool stuff but a big drawback was the company stuck with the same tools it always used and very rarely adopted some new technologies being used. </p>   
                <p>We kept reinventing the wheel when we could have used off the shelf open source products that had already been built and had solved the common problems and already overcome all the teething issues that arose with building something from scratch. Some examples would be:
                </p>
                <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                    <div role="listitem" class="item">Caching data layer (called SiteServer) rather than using something like memcahced</div>

                </div>
                <p> These are just some of the examples. It led to the company losing its ground as the market leader and projects taking longer to develop than they could have. But for the developers in the company it meant that nothing new from a technology standpoint was learned.  Because we were a ‘Time & Materials’ company we didn’t get given the time for experimentation/learning/R&D and had to focus on billable hours. People got bored of doing the same thing over and over. Some people left, some people move into more managerial positions (like me). But on the whole people did not progress their breadth of technology tools while there. Having moved to Sky where there is much more diverse

                <p>For awhile now I've been thinking about geting back into coding as a bit of a hobby. This was triggered in work recently while helping out triaging issues in the runup to a project go live. I ran some sql queries and grepped some logs on a docker container. It was nothing crazy but it reminded me that I enjoyed this when I was a developer - understandign a system and getting to the route of a problem.
                </p>
                <p>So I decided I wanted to create something. But where to start? There are so many new languages to use now like, Python, Java 12, Node. Also it's no longer just about languages. There are many new frameworks & tools used to write, build, test, configure and deploy an applicaiton. Even version control has moved on. Git is widely used now whereas 'back in my day' CVS or SVN were used. i realise as I write this how old this is making me sound.
                </p>
                <p> Which front-end frameworks to pick? Angular v React for example. I had so much to learn. Where would I find time to do any of this in between having a family with 3 kids, work and planning our return back to Ireland. To be honest it became a bit overwhelming and i got stuck in a state of stagnation and not doing anything at all.
                </p>
                <p> Eventually I got a grip of myself and after a new "Get into Technology" apprentice joined our team, it made me realise how much I actually do know. So yes I haven't used all the latest and greatest modern technolgoies but I do have a good solid background in building working software solutions so I just need to work on reskilling myself in the languages and frameworks that are used these days. As well as this, there have never been as much resouces on the internet and courses on pluralsight etc. to use. So there are no excuses really. 
                </p>
                <p>I decided to approach it like I approach large projects or difficult tasks at work. Don’t try to eat the elephant all at once, break it down and eat one bite at a time. This was the same message I was telling the apprentice while coaching her up and trying to re-assure her that yes there was a lot to learn but just to take it one step at a time. So I chose to practice what I preached and applied it to myself also. I am going to set some basic goals, pick a project, start simple and iterate from there. Along the way we can layer in different tools as we go to add to the learning. Some of the ideaas I had in my head for a project:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Create a nice interactive website</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Write some python to pull information from Strava using it’s APIs and create my own custom front end to display that stats and figures I wanted with some pretty graphs</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Use a NoSQL DB like Couchbase, Mongo etc.</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Learn an OO programming using Java</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Do something with a raspberry pie</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Write a mobile app - Andriod or iOs</div>
                    </div>
                I decided to go with a Website. I needed to update my CV anyway for applying for job applications for my move to Cork so wy not create a website to host this information and potentially display this info a bit nicer than a traditional CV would.
                </p><p> 
                Rather than jumping straight into a Javascript framework and hooking it up to a DB, let’s start with building a static website. Doing this will help get back into simple HTML, CSS and some JS as well as getting used to GIT as version control (I used CVS). Once that is done we can expand into something more elaborate. So that's the plan. Let's see how it works out ...

                <p>Today I discovered Semantic UI. It’s exactly the type of thing I had been looking for. A nice boot strapped CSS with a simple consistent and clean look and feel to it out of the box. 
                <p>Importantly it has really good <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html">documentation with sample usage</a>. To start off you simply need to include the relevant semantic CSS and JS files into your page. There is some JQuery code you can use as well to bring the CSS attributes to life via JS to show how to use them. </p>
                <p>A 60 min intro tutorial on <a href="ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9mUH1EWp40">YouTube</a></p>
                <p> To run you’d need to:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Npm to install semantic UI</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Gulp to  build and compile code to create local semantic CSS and JS files</div>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>In the demo he sourced versions of these files from cloud CDNs and then later he built the compiled code later to create the local files. </p>
                <p>Once you install semantic, then you can overwrite the default themes if you wish for certain attributes. </p>
