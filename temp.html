                            <p>I was originally brought into the department I joined Sky with, to help establish a good culture and develop good engineering practices through Agile ways of working. This was done by leading by example and embedding some of the good engineering practices I learned at OpenBet, taking line management and career progression of employees seriously and changing the mind-set of the department to be focussed on building the software for the long term through ownership and by placing a priority in non-functional requirements like supportability, performance etc. and not just short term project deadlines.</p>

                                <div role="listitem" class="item">As Technical Lead, I led a successful delivery and launch of a new Sports Betting website, back-end trading software and retail integration for a new OpenBet Customer in Canada, Atlantic Lottery, all while working with the client from their offices in New Brunswick.  I was involved in the project from the start and responsible for the entire project lifecycle from requirements gathering, solution design, development, testing, training and delivery to production.</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">As Development Manager, I led a large team and was technically responsible for the Coral Account of up to 40 people distributed in 3 teams across London, Romania and Athens.  As well as delivering new functionality through the year a part of a regular release cycle, Coral had a very successful Grand National from a system performance point of view with their highest peak bets/minute achieved to that point.</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">At OpenBet I have been involved in and have experience in all stages of the software development life cycle - RFP responses, requirements gathering, analysis, solution design, development, testing, releases, production support, performance monitoring and improvements. Engineers are involved in all these activities and not just restricted to development and engineering managers are responsible for all of these phases for their team/client account.</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">On the Coral account I helped transition the team from a waterfall methodology to a more Agile way of working by introducing Scrum, having a Coral Product Owner embedded in the team, introducing more regular releases and helped the team become more efficient by having less context switching by splitting the team into distinct functions to allow team to concentrate on priorities from the relevant business owner for that particular business stream – BAU & Production Support, Sprint Feature Development, Analysis, Releases</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">I developed and built up working relationships with all the clients whose teams I worked on. This was particularly important as a Technical Lead/Development manager where as the technical point of contact for OpenBet for the account there was lots of stakeholder management with senior stakeholders from the client like CTOs, Sportsbook Directors, Senior Project Managers, Steering Boards etc. This was done by being honest, creating good communication lines and building trust with a proven track record of delivering for them over time.</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">While line managing people in lots of different engineering roles (Developers, Analysts, Testers, Technical Leads, Scrum Masters) through coaching and mentoring, I have helped with their career progression to roles such as Senior Developer, Technical Lead and Development Manager.</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">Through roles such as Senior Developer, Technical Lead and Development Manager I had technical responsibility for the accounts, which meant taking responsibility for the quality of software being produced, assisting development staff in developing solutions to software-related problems, execution of regular code reviews to ensure the production system was performant, resilient, PCI compliant and scalable to meet demand. This involved collaborating and working closely with client teams and 3rd parties (PMs, Architects, Analysts, Test Leads, Release Managers) in arriving at and building solutions to meet their needs and requirements while still adhering to OpenBet's high technical standards.</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">Collaborated with other OpenBet Technical leads, Development managers, the CTO and Commercial Account Directors in applying OpenBet company strategy and objectives (commercially and technically) to the team and client account I was managing. From authoring and policing technical standards, promoting code reuse, exchanging ideas and to planning the roll out of new strategic OpenBet products for the commercial success of the account.</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">Worked on the OpenBet support team for 6 months, supporting all clients live production systems as the first line of support including out of hours. This high pressure environment was a great learning experience with exposure to all the client code bases and different type of client accounts (small and large). It helped focus on what needs doing when building software solutions from a non-functional point of view for resiliency and performance.</div>
                                <div role="listitem" class="item">As a full stack Senior Developer I was involved multiple website redesigns. I was lead developer for the BlueSq Sportsbook redesign ahead of the 2006 world cup. I was Technical Lead for Sportech for their football pools website redesign and on Totesport I was Senior Developer on the team that delivered the new Tote website, all high profile project launches for the company and the clients at the time.</div>

                            <div role="listitem" class="item">As Technical Lead, I led a successful delivery and launch of a new Sports Betting website, back-end trading software and retail integration for a new OpenBet Customer in Canada, Atlantic Lottery, all while working with the client from their offices in New Brunswick.  I was involved in the project from the start and responsible for the entire project lifecycle from requirements gathering, solution design, development, testing, training and delivery to production.</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">As Development Manager, I led a large team and was technically responsible for the Coral Account of up to 40 people distributed in 3 teams across London, Romania and Athens.  As well as delivering new functionality through the year a part of a regular release cycle, Coral had a very successful Grand National from a system performance point of view with their highest peak bets/minute achieved to that point.</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">At OpenBet I have been involved in and have experience in all stages of the software development life cycle - RFP responses, requirements gathering, analysis, solution design, development, testing, releases, production support, performance monitoring and improvements. Engineers are involved in all these activities and not just restricted to development and engineering managers are responsible for all of these phases for their team/client account.</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">On the Coral account I helped transition the team from a waterfall methodology to a more Agile way of working by introducing Scrum, having a Coral Product Owner embedded in the team, introducing more regular releases and helped the team become more efficient by having less context switching by splitting the team into distinct functions to allow team to concentrate on priorities from the relevant business owner for that particular business stream – BAU & Production Support, Sprint Feature Development, Analysis, Releases</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">I developed and built up working relationships with all the clients whose teams I worked on. This was particularly important as a Technical Lead/Development manager where as the technical point of contact for OpenBet for the account there was lots of stakeholder management with senior stakeholders from the client like CTOs, Sportsbook Directors, Senior Project Managers, Steering Boards etc. This was done by being honest, creating good communication lines and building trust with a proven track record of delivering for them over time.</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">While line managing people in lots of different engineering roles (Developers, Analysts, Testers, Technical Leads, Scrum Masters) through coaching and mentoring, I have helped with their career progression to roles such as Senior Developer, Technical Lead and Development Manager.</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">Through roles such as Senior Developer, Technical Lead and Development Manager I had technical responsibility for the accounts, which meant taking responsibility for the quality of software being produced, assisting development staff in developing solutions to software-related problems, execution of regular code reviews to ensure the production system was performant, resilient, PCI compliant and scalable to meet demand. This involved collaborating and working closely with client teams and 3rd parties (PMs, Architects, Analysts, Test Leads, Release Managers) in arriving at and building solutions to meet their needs and requirements while still adhering to OpenBet's high technical standards.</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">Collaborated with other OpenBet Technical leads, Development managers, the CTO and Commercial Account Directors in applying OpenBet company strategy and objectives (commercially and technically) to the team and client account I was managing. From authoring and policing technical standards, promoting code reuse, exchanging ideas and to planning the roll out of new strategic OpenBet products for the commercial success of the account.</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">Worked on the OpenBet support team for 6 months, supporting all clients live production systems as the first line of support including out of hours. This high pressure environment was a great learning experience with exposure to all the client code bases and different type of client accounts (small and large). It helped focus on what needs doing when building software solutions from a non-functional point of view for resiliency and performance.</div>
                            <div role="listitem" class="item">As a full stack Senior Developer I was involved multiple website redesigns. I was lead developer for the BlueSq Sportsbook redesign ahead of the 2006 world cup. I was Technical Lead for Sportech for their football pools website redesign and on Totesport I was Senior Developer on the team that delivered the new Tote website, all high profile project launches for the company and the clients at the time.</div>
