                                                    <p>I am an software engineering manager with more than 16 years experience in software engineering and a background in development. I take pride in delivering software solutions end to end using good engineering practices and also, importantly progressing the skill and careers of the people I have managed.

                                                    <p>At <a href="https://www.openbet.com/">OpenBet</a> I started as a full stack Software Developer and progressed through a range of roles, moving to Senior Developer, Technical Lead and finally to Development Manager. I led teams delivering front-end websites and back-end sportsbook trading, gaming and account management software for many of OpenBet’s biggest clients such as Coral, Betfair, Rank and Tote to mention a few.</p>

                                                    <p>I managed teams split across different OpenBet sites - London, Athens and Romania. I also worked onsite at a new client’s Canadian office for the duration of a project, in New Brunswick, Canada, leading a team in the development and rollout of a new front-end sportsbook, retail integration and back-end trading solution for Atlantic Lottery.</p>

                                                    <p>At <a href="https://www.skygroup.sky/">Sky</a> I held engineering managerial roles in a few different teams and departmetns, building and maintaining back end broadcast software. This software is used to setup the programming for the linear tv schedules, on-demand and streaming for traditional set top box customers as well as the OTT (Over The Top) devices like mobile and tablets for the Sky and NowTV customers to consume.</p>

                                                    <p>I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science (1st Class Honours) and an MSc in Multimedia from University College Cork.</p>

                                                    <p>I am married with 3 children and having lived away from Cork, in Londan and in Canada for the last 16 years, we decided it was time for us to move our family back home. I am looking for a software engineering role in Cork.<p>

                                                    <p>I was originally brought into the department I joined Sky with, to help establish a good culture and develop good engineering practices through Agile ways of working. This was achieved by leading by example and embedding some of the good engineering practices I learned at OpenBet, taking line management and career progression of employees seriously and changing the mind-set of the department to be focussed on building the software for the long term through ownership and by placing a priority in non-functional requirements like supportability, performance etc. and not just short term project deadlines.</p>
