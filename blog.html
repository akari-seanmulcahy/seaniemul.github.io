                <p>How do you make culture and attitude change at a deptartment level? </p>
                <p>A few years ago we started this proces in the department I was in. It was an old school menatality department with more of a waterfall non agile mindset by the people running it and also from the developers on the ground. Releases were 'Big Bang' project releases every quarter (at best), which had major months long test phases running up to them. Small but important changes or simple bug fixes got held up and had to wait on the release train. A lot of the time these changes not only didn't make it into the next release but the release after that, as code wasd locked down for this rigourous manually testing phase. Even still most releases had serious bugs in them. Multiple major branches had to be maintained and merging was big ordeal becayuse of all this causing more bugs as this happend after all the testing on the project branch.</p>
                <p>Work was siloed and the development teams only cared about the project they were working on. A dedicated support team managed support of the production system. The did lots of fire fighting and quenched lots of fires. It was a bit of a hero mentatlity. Because of the silo the development team weren't involved in investigating root cause for these production issues, most of them didn't even have access to producion. Becuase of this environment developers never learned from these prod incidents and instead of engineering an applicaiton to avoid pitfalls learned from previous epxeriences or issues the same basic issues cropped up over and over again. A simple example of this was that data changes would constantly be applied on produciton rather than fixing </p>
                <p><ul>
            <li>siloed work between dev and support</li>
            <li> support heros quenching fires rather than the teams building the apps stopping the fires hanppening in the first place</li>
            <li> no real agile culture, monolith application</li>
            <li> lots of contracts v permies, people who have seen people try to make change/transform change before and failed and are resistant</li>
            <li> use some projects as example projects to show how changes can be releases faster</li>
            </ul>      </p>
                            <p>resistance to change - get a key group to drive the change and identify people within the teams who will help to get the teams to adopt the changes. </p>
                            <p>Results: Teams assigned ownershuip of applicaitons.
                            Takes time, long game </p>


            <p>Kind of similar process to defining Department Values. For buy-in you’d need a lot of people to buy into it and a good way to do that is to involve them in coming up with a process like below. As discussed probably a cross over between some of the below themes and some of the people survey initiatives going on currently.
             
            </p><p>
            Managed to find the old confluence pages for this. The 2 main ones being:
            http://confluence.bse.intranet.sky:8090/display/WW/Software+Principles
            which was mainly defined by the Tech people
            </p><p> 
            and
            http://confluence.bse.intranet.sky:8090/display/WW/Continuous+Improvement
            with the sub-pages for the following themes:
            <ul>
            <li>People</li>
            <li>Curate - Build the right thing</li>
            <li>Deliver - Build it effectively</li>
            <li>Code - Build the thing right</li>
            <li>Test</li>
            <li>Deploy</li>
            </ul>
            So each of these themes was broken down further by groups of people brainstorming things/behaviours to move From -> To.
            </p><p>
            Here’s an example of the people one:
            </p><p>
            <h4>People</h4> 
            We attract the best people and keep them highly engaged and motivated in a challenging and fun environment
            Beyond "Basic job titles" -> Job families & core competencies
            What is job families and core competencies?
            Creating a clear & consistent career progression path, to encourage personal development at Sky. Identifying a framework for people to work against to develop their skills. 
            Beyond "Generic training courses" -> Knowledge improvement
            What is knowledge improvement?
            Increasing the team's knowledge of industry tools, methods and trends, as well as Sky & department-specific information. the better informed our people are, the better the choices they can make.
            Beyond "Reactive resourcing" -> Building stable capability
            Beyond "Reviewing CVs" -> Identifying talent 
            Beyond "Onboarding" -> A Warm Welcome
            </p><p> 
            From there we listed ‘What are we doing now?’ and then ‘Next Steps’ to create specific tasks to help progress towards achieving these goals.
             </p><p>
             
             
            So lots of this material won’t be relevant to the current department as believe it or not we are more progressive !
            </p><p> 
            You may not have access to these old confluence pages so I have added PDFs of them.

                <p> OpenBet did some pretty cool stuff but a big drawback was the company stuck with the same tools it always used and very rarely adopted some new technologies being used. </p>   
                <p>We kept reinventing the wheel when we could have used off the shelf open source products that had already been built and had solved the common problems and already overcome all the teething issues that arose with building something from scratch. Some examples would be:
                </p>

                    <div role="listitem" class="item">Caching data layer (called SiteServer) rather than using something like memcahced</div>

                </div>
                <p> These are just some of the examples. It led to the company losing its ground as the market leader and projects taking longer to develop than they could have. But for the developers in the company it meant that nothing new from a technology standpoint was learned.  Because we were a ‘Time & Materials’ company we didn’t get given the time for experimentation/learning/R&D and had to focus on billable hours. People got bored of doing the same thing over and over. Some people left, some people move into more managerial positions (like me). But on the whole people didn’t progress their breadth of technology tools while there. Having moved to Sky where there is much more diverse

                <p>There are so many frameworks/languages/frameworks/tools to use now. As well as this there were so many things I had in my head I wanted to do. Just some of the ideas:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Create a nice interactive website</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Write some python to pull information from Strava using it’s APIs and create my own custom front end to display that stats and figures I wanted with some pretty graphs</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Learn an OO programming using Java</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Do something with a raspberry pie</div>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p> But where to start? Which frameworks to pick? Angular v React for example. I had so much to learn. Where would I find time to do any of this in between having a family with 3 kids, work and planning our return back to Ireland. To be honest it became a bit overwhelming and i got stuck in a state of stagnation and not doing anything at all. 
                </p>
                <p> Eventually I got a grip of myself and decided to approach it like I approach large projects or difficult tasks at work. Don’t try to eat the elephant all at once, do it one bite at a time. So i decided to set some basic goals and iterate from there. Rather than jumping straight into a Javascript framework and hooking it up to a DB, let’s start with building a static website. Doing this will help get back into simple HTML, CSS and some JS as well as getting used to GIT as version control (I used CVS). Once that is done we can expand into something more elaborate.

                <p>Today I discovered Semantic UI. It’s exactly the type of thing I had been looking for. A nice boot strapped CSS with a simple consistent and clean look and feel to it out of the box. 
                <p>Importantly it has really good <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html">documentation with sample usage</a>. To start off you simply need to include the relevant semantic CSS and JS files into your page. There is some JQuery code you can use as well to bring the CSS attributes to life via JS to show how to use them. </p>
                <p>A 60 min intro tutorial on <a href="ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9mUH1EWp40">YouTube</a></p>
                <p> To run you’d need to:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Npm to install semantic UI</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Gulp to  build and compile code to create local semantic CSS and JS files</div>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>In the demo he sourced versions of these files from cloud CDNs and then later he built the compiled code later to create the local files. </p>
                <p>Once you install semantic, then you can overwrite the default themes if you wish for certain attributes. </p>

                    <p>A few of us attended a course on ‘The Art of Visualising Software Architecture’ which was run by <a href="https://simonbrown.je/">Simon Brown</a>.</p>
                    <p>The main points we learnt was about visualising the architecture of a system by:</p>

                        <li>use of a consistent style/standard to be used in the diagrams</li>
                        <li>use different levels to drill into the right amount of detail - a bit like google maps</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> A lot of this is common sense but we don't end up doing it!</p>

                    <p>Before we learned how to do it properly we split into groups and made an attempt to come up with diagrams of a system. In our case we focussed on the ADI Builder as part of Messenger.</p>

                    <h5>Results/Conclusions:</h5>
                    <p>The results were much better! We took an action to create C4 diagrams for applications within the department. We ended up with consistent diagrams that everyone could understand and reason about. We then used these diagrams to illustrate proposed architectural changes through projects or rework. It proved extremely useful for example in refactoring some of the applications, helping us decide how to separate & group things more logically.</p>
