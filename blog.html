                <p>How do you make culture and attitude change at a department level? </p>
                <p>A few years ago we started this process in the department I was in. It was an old school mentality department with more of a waterfall non agile mindset by the people running it and also from the developers on the ground. Releases were 'Big Bang' project releases every quarter (at best), which had major months long test phases running up to them. Small but important changes or simple bug fixes got held up and had to wait on the release train. A lot of the time these changes not only didn't make it into the next release but the release after that, as code was locked down for this rigorous manually testing phase. Even still most releases had serious bugs in them. Multiple major branches had to be maintained and merging was big ordeal because of all this causing more bugs as this happened after all the testing on the project branch.</p>
                <p>Work was siloed and the development teams only cared about the project they were working on. A dedicated support team managed support of the production system. The did lots of fire fighting and quenched lots of fires. It was a bit of a hero mentality. Because of the silo the development team weren't involved in investigating root cause for these production issues, most of them didn't even have access to production. Because of this environment developers never learned from these prod incidents and instead of engineering an application to avoid pitfalls learned from previous experiences or issues the same basic issues cropped up over and over again. A simple example of this was that data changes would constantly be applied on production rather than fixing </p>
                <p><ul>
                <li> Siloed work between dev and support</li>
                <li> support heroes quenching fires rather than the teams building the apps stopping the fires happening in the first place</li>
                <li> no real agile culture, monolith application</li>
                <li> lots of contracts v permies, people who have seen people try to make changes / transform change before and failed and are resistant</li>
                <li> use some projects as example projects to show how changes can be releases faster</li>
                </ul>      </p>
                                <p>resistance to change - get a key group to drive the change and identify people within the teams who will help to get the teams to adopt the changes. </p>
                                <p>Results: Teams assigned ownership of applications.
                                Takes time, long game 
                                </p>
                <p>Kind of similar process to defining Department Values. For buy-in you’d need a lot of people to buy into it and a good way to do that is to involve them in coming up with a process like below. As discussed probably a cross over between some of the below themes and some of the people survey initiatives going on currently.
                 
                </p><p>
                Managed to find the old confluence pages for this. The 2 main ones being:
                http://confluence.bse.intranet.sky:8090/display/WW/Software+Principles
                which was mainly defined by the Tech people
                </p><p> 
                and
                http://confluence.bse.intranet.sky:8090/display/WW/Continuous+Improvement
                with the sub-pages for the following themes:
                <ul>
                <li>People</li>
                <li>Curate - Build the right thing</li>
                <li>Deliver - Build it effectively</li>
                <li>Code - Build the thing right</li>
                <li>Test</li>
                <li>Deploy</li>
                </ul>
                So each of these themes was broken down further by groups of people brainstorming things / behaviours to move From -> To.
                </p><p>
                Here is an example of the people one:
                </p><p>
                <h4>People</h4> 
                We attract the best people and keep them highly engaged and motivated in a challenging and fun environment
                Beyond "Basic job titles" -> Job families & core competencies
                What is job families and core competencies?
                Creating a clear & consistent career progression path, to encourage personal development at Sky. Identifying a framework for people to work against to develop their skills. 
                Beyond "Generic training courses" -> Knowledge improvement
                What is knowledge improvement?
                Increasing the team's knowledge of industry tools, methods and trends, as well as Sky & department-specific information. the better informed our people are, the better the choices they can make.
                Beyond "Reactive resourcing" -> Building stable capability
                Beyond "Reviewing CVs" -> Identifying talent 
                Beyond "Onboarding" -> A Warm Welcome
                </p><p> 
                From there we listed ‘What are we doing now?’ and then ‘Next Steps’ to create specific tasks to help progress towards achieving these goals.
                 </p><p>
                 
                 
                So lots of this material won’t be relevant to the current department as believe it or not we are more progressive !
                </p><p> 
                You may not have access to these old confluence pages so I have added PDFs of them.

                <p>
                    Took over a team that had very low morale due to lots of reasons, here are some of them:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disgruntled employees unhappy with previous line manager and last set of annual appraisals</li>
                        <li>Was told by the previous manager in the handover that a few people were likely to leave soon</li>
                        <li>Too Much Support work and not enough new engineering / development</li>
                        <li>Architects Silo - handed off projects late in the decision making process</li>
                        <li>High ratio of contractors to permanent staff in the team</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="ui yellow header">Task:</h4>
                    Try and keep the team together and motivated, stable and avoid having too much of a brain drain at the same time. All while delivering important projects for Sky.
                    <h3>Line management</h3>
                    <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Held more regular one to ones</li>
                        <li>Gave everyone a blank slate, whatever issues individuals had with previous manager would be put to one side (he said / she said), would be judged on what I saw of them from that point on</li>
                        <li>Over first few months tried to get to know the team members and what motivated them</li>
                        <li>some wanted more money, some wanted more interesting work, some wanted more feedback in 1 on 1's</li>
                        <li>Told the we can only control the controllables, what do we have control of within the team to change</li>
                        <li>Focus on individuals and their career progression. Set goals for people to achieve within the team and if they succeeded in those then they would warrant good appraisals and from there may come good financial reward or promotion etc. If the budget etc was there then that would influence percentage increases etc. Also set technical goals for areas to improve on with a long term aim of promotion to next level. </li>
                        <li>Succession planning: recruit more permanent staff with a longer term goal of training them up and having them in place if people were to leave over time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Team happier that more focus was put on them as individuals, their concerns and their career progression</li>
                        <li>Team morale improved</li>
                        <li>Permanent people trained up as others (mainly contractors) left the team over time</li>
                        <li>Peoples Objectives set and also where appropriate aligned with team delivery</li>
                        <li>People progressed in their careers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Support</h3>
                    <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduced Support Rota & new support process with priority being paramount</li>
                        <li>Setup Kanban JIRA project for other teams to raise tickets and have visibility of them and what they are competing against in terms of priorities</li>
                        <li>Support Tool created to better track the status of assets</li>
                        <li>Team took feedback from support users and other teams on requirements to improve this app</li>
                        <li>Put a tax on new projects to allow money and time to be spent on this new support process</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A well-defined support process for other teams to follow, rather than the adhoc methods used before</li>
                        <li>Less context switching between support admin, checking email, and doing feature work. Pair dedicated to support each day. Rest of team could concentrate on the feature work.</li>
                        <li>Better team efficiency as a result</li>
                        <li>Priority support items were addressed in an appropriate time frame</li>
                        <li>More visibility and better comms around where support issues were at, therefore reduced emails and chasing from other teams</li>
                        <li>Happier team</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Architecture</h3>
                    <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                    <ul>

                <h4 class="ui red header">Situation:</h4>
                <p>An old school developer in attitude and skill set, who had a bad reputation competency wise, and from a work ethic point of view, mainly because of the group she hung out with. She was perceived to have been hanging off the coat tails of others and it wasn't clear what her contribution was or if she was a competent developer or not.
                </p>
                <h4 class="ui yellow header">Task:</h4>
                <p>Try and improver he skills and also decide if she was someone we wanted to keep in the team / company.</p>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Action:</h4>
                <p>I gave her a fresh start on a new team that we formed. The team ways of working, was going to be more agile and modern than where she had come from. There was a graduate on this team who had a great attitude and work ethic, although she was young, Ellen set a good example for people like her to realise they had no excuses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                She clearly had to improve her development skills. In 1-1's she acknowledged this and we came up with objectives for her to improve her coding. It was clear from talking to her that she lacked confidence. We came up with ways she could contribute to the new team outside of coding. She had the most domain knowledge and she could step up and take more ownerships of task.  </p>
                <p>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                She started to embrace the news ways of working. She had the domain knowledge and was able to help get the team get up to speed and also help break down the tasks from an analysis stand point She also took ownership of her tasks and started to deliver. Over time by pairing with the stronger developers in the team she started to improve her coding. Since then she has been seen to taking the lead on the teams she has been on since.

                        <h4>CI/CD - Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery</h4>
                        Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. 
                        <img class="ui fluid image" src="./static/images/CI_diag.png">
                        By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

                            <li>Maintain a single source repository</li>
                            <li>(Encourages) frequent commits</li>
                            <li>Automate the build</li>
                            <li>Make your build self-testing</li>
                            <li>Fail fast</li>
                            <li>Every commit should build on an integration machine</li>
                            <li>Safe rollback option</li>
                            <li>Snapshot deployments - Make it easy for anyone to get the latest executable version</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Continuous Deployment</h4>
                        Continuous Deployment is closely related to Continuous Integration and refers to the release into production of software that passes the automated tests - Essentially, it is the practice of releasing every good build to users, ideally multiple times a day.

                <p> OpenBet did some pretty cool stuff but a big drawback was the company stuck with the same tools it always used and very rarely adopted some new technologies being used. </p>   
                <p>We kept reinventing the wheel when we could have used off the shelf open source products that had already been built and had solved the common problems and already overcome all the teething issues that arose with building something from scratch. Some examples would be:

                </div>
                <p> These are just some of the examples. It led to the company losing its ground as the market leader and projects taking longer to develop than they could have. But for the developers in the company it meant that nothing new from a technology standpoint was learned.  Because we were a ‘Time & Materials’ company we didn’t get given the time for experimentation/learning/R&D and had to focus on billable hours. People got bored of doing the same thing over and over. Some people left, some people move into more managerial positions (like me). But on the whole people did not progress their breadth of technology tools while there.

                <p>There are so many frameworks/languages/frameworks/tools to use now. As well as this there were so many things I had in my head I wanted to do. Just some of the ideas:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Create a nice interactive website</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Write some python to pull information from Strava using it’s APIs and create my own custom front end to display that stats and figures I wanted with some pretty graphs</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Learn an OO programming using Java</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Do something with a raspberry pie</div>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p> But where to start? Which frameworks to pick? Angular v React for example. I had so much to learn. Where would I find time to do any of this in between having a family with 3 kids, work and planning our return back to Ireland. To be honest it became a bit overwhelming and i got stuck in a state of stagnation and not doing anything at all. 
                </p>
                <p> Eventually I got a grip of myself and decided to approach it like I approach large projects or difficult tasks at work. Don’t try to eat the elephant all at once, do it one bite at a time. So i decided to set some basic goals and iterate from there. Rather than jumping straight into a Javascript framework and hooking it up to a DB, let’s start with building a static website. Doing this will help get back into simple HTML, CSS and some JS as well as getting used to GIT as version control (I used CVS). Once that is done we can expand into something more elaborate.

                <p>Today I discovered Semantic UI. It’s exactly the type of thing I had been looking for. A nice boot strapped CSS with a simple consistent and clean look and feel to it out of the box. 
                <p>Importantly it has really good <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html">documentation with sample usage</a>. To start off you simply need to include the relevant semantic CSS and JS files into your page. There is some JQuery code you can use as well to bring the CSS attributes to life via JS to show how to use them. </p>

                <p> To run you’d need to:

                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Npm to install semantic UI</div>

                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>In the demo he sourced versions of these files from cloud CDNs and then later he built the compiled code later to create the local files. </p>
                <p>Once you install semantic, then you can overwrite the default themes if you wish for certain attributes. </p>

                    <h5>Results/Conclusions:</h5>
                    <p>The results were much better! We took an action to create C4 diagrams for applications within the department. We ended up with consistent diagrams that everyone could understand and reason about. We then used these diagrams to illustrate proposed architectural changes through projects or rework. It proved extremely useful for example in refactoring some of the applications, helping us decide how to separate & group things more logically.</p>
