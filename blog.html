                <h2 class="ui red header">Situation:</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the teams I took over had very low morale. This due to lots of reasons, here are some of them:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disgruntled employees unhappy with previous line manager and last set of annual appraisals</li>
                        <li>Was told by the previous manager in the handover that a few people were likely to leave soon</li>
                        <li>Too Much Support work and not enough new engineering / development</li>
                        <li>Architects Silo - handed off projects late in the decision-making process</li>
                        <li>High ratio of contractors to permanent staff in the team</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2 class="ui yellow header">Task:</h2>
                <p>Try and keep the team together and motivated, stable and avoid having too much of a brain drain at the same time. All while delivering important projects for the company.</p>

                <h2 class="ui green header">What did I do?</h2>
                <p>Here are some of the things that I did to try and improve the situation. Most of it is probably common sense but for some reason it wasn't done previously. Lots of simple changes had an overall positive impact.</p>

                <h3>Line management</h3>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Held more regular one to ones</li>
                    <li>Gave everyone a blank slate, whatever issues individuals had with previous manager would be put to one side (he said / she said), would be judged on what I saw of them from that point on</li>
                    <li>Over first few months tried to get to know the team members and what motivated them</li>
                    <li>Some wanted more money, some wanted more interesting work, some wanted more feedback in 1 on 1's</li>
                    <li>Told them we can only control the controllables, what do we have control of within the team to change</li>
                    <li>Focus on individuals and their career progression. Set goals for people to achieve within the team and if they succeeded in those then they would warrant good appraisals and from there may come good financial reward or promotion etc. depending on budget. Also set technical goals for areas to improve on with a long-term aim of promotion to next level. </li>
                    <li>Succession planning: recruit more permanent staff with a longer-term goal of training them up and having them in place if people were to leave over time.</li>
                    <li>Let go of some long-standing contractors.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Team happier that more focus was put on them as individuals, their concerns and their career progression</li>
                    <li>Team morale improved</li>
                    <li>Peoples Objectives set and also where appropriate aligned with team delivery gave clearer focus on what they had to do to progress</li>
                    <li>Contractors leaving helped give more ownership and responsibility to the permanent employees and allowed room for some of them to step up and fill the knowledge, experience and leadership void by those who left. This extra exposure helped them take steps forwards in their career progression where some of them were promoted to Senior Developers for example</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Support</h3>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduced Support Rota & new support process with priority being paramount</li>
                    <li>Setup Kanban JIRA project for other teams to raise tickets and have visibility of them and what they are competing against in terms of priorities</li>
                    <li>Support Tool created to better track the status of assets</li>
                    <li>Team took feedback from support users and other teams on requirements to improve this app</li>
                    <li>Put a tax on new projects to allow money and time to be spent on this new support process</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A well-defined support process for other teams to follow, rather than the adhoc methods used before</li>
                    <li>Less context switching between support admin, checking email, and doing feature work. Pair dedicated to support each day. Rest of team could concentrate on the feature work.</li>
                    <li>Better team efficiency as a result</li>
                    <li>Priority support items were addressed in an appropriate time frame</li>
                    <li>More visibility and better comms around where support issues were at, therefore reduced emails and chasing from other teams</li>
                    <li>Happier team</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Architecture</h3>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weekly Architects meetings to discuss questions on current work and also an introduction to upcoming projects or changes, that the team could feed ideas back for</li>
                    <li>Team took control of the architectural tools /documentation (API definitions, descriptions on the mappings of outputs to the inputs) for their team and application</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>More ownership of the product / application</li>
                    <li>Better understanding of the requested changes and requirements as a result of the increased comms with architects</li>
                    <li>Better working relationship with the architects</li>
                    <li>Ended up with a more resilient and supportable application</li>
                    <li>Ownership and version control of the mapping documentation & APIs so that the team could publish what version was live and what was future 'to be state versions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Engineering</h3>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I got the team to identify what technical debt / architectural changes to the app they would make to make it more supportable and resilient.</li>
                    <li>Set up 'theme of the month' to focus entire team on one theme goal for the month from the technical backlog.</li>
                    <li>Set up monitoring dashboards and alerting stack using Prometheus/Grafana</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> This generated a backlog of work (like performance improvements, CI/CD pipeline improvements, monitoring and alerting etc.) to improve the application and setup.</li>
                    <li>The team had ownership of this work as they had come up with it and were passionate about it</li>
                    <li>the theme of the month helped everyone work on the same thing, gaining momentum and meant there was a decent amount to showcase at the end of the month from the fruits of their labour</li>
                    <li>Team became proactive rather than reactive in terms of up issues being raised from the alerts</li>
                </ul>

                <p>How do you make culture and attitude change at a department level? </p>
                <p>A few years ago we started this process in the department I was in. It was an old school mentality department with more of a waterfall non agile mindset by the people running it and also from the developers on the ground. Releases were 'Big Bang' project releases every quarter (at best), which had major months long test phases running up to them. Small but important changes or simple bug fixes got held up and had to wait on the release train. A lot of the time these changes not only didn't make it into the next release but the release after that, as code was locked down for this rigorous manually testing phase. Even still most releases had serious bugs in them. Multiple major branches had to be maintained and merging was big ordeal because of all this causing more bugs as this happened after all the testing on the project branch.</p>
                <p>Work was siloed and the development teams only cared about the project they were working on. A dedicated support team managed support of the production system. The did lots of fire fighting and quenched lots of fires. It was a bit of a hero mentality. Because of the silo the development team weren't involved in investigating root cause for these production issues, most of them didn't even have access to production. Because of this environment developers never learned from these prod incidents and instead of engineering an application to avoid pitfalls learned from previous experiences or issues the same basic issues cropped up over and over again. A simple example of this was that data changes would constantly be applied on production rather than fixing </p>
                <p><ul>
                <li> Siloed work between dev and support</li>
                <li> support heroes quenching fires rather than the teams building the apps stopping the fires happening in the first place</li>
                <li> no real agile culture, monolith application</li>
                <li> lots of contracts v permies, people who have seen people try to make changes / transform change before and failed and are resistant</li>
                <li> use some projects as example projects to show how changes can be releases faster</li>
                </ul>      </p>
                                <p>resistance to change - get a key group to drive the change and identify people within the teams who will help to get the teams to adopt the changes. </p>
                                <p>Results: Teams assigned ownership of applications.
                                Takes time, long game 
                                </p>
                <p>Kind of similar process to defining Department Values. For buy-in you’d need a lot of people to buy into it and a good way to do that is to involve them in coming up with a process like below. As discussed probably a cross over between some of the below themes and some of the people survey initiatives going on currently.
                 
                </p><p>
                Managed to find the old confluence pages for this. The 2 main ones being:
                http://confluence.bse.intranet.sky:8090/display/WW/Software+Principles
                which was mainly defined by the Tech people
                </p><p> 
                and
                http://confluence.bse.intranet.sky:8090/display/WW/Continuous+Improvement
                with the sub-pages for the following themes:
                <ul>
                <li>People</li>
                <li>Curate - Build the right thing</li>
                <li>Deliver - Build it effectively</li>
                <li>Code - Build the thing right</li>
                <li>Test</li>
                <li>Deploy</li>
                </ul>
                So each of these themes was broken down further by groups of people brainstorming things / behaviours to move From -> To.
                </p><p>
                Here is an example of the people one:
                </p><p>
                <h4>People</h4> 
                We attract the best people and keep them highly engaged and motivated in a challenging and fun environment
                Beyond "Basic job titles" -> Job families & core competencies
                What is job families and core competencies?
                Creating a clear & consistent career progression path, to encourage personal development at Sky. Identifying a framework for people to work against to develop their skills. 
                Beyond "Generic training courses" -> Knowledge improvement
                What is knowledge improvement?
                Increasing the team's knowledge of industry tools, methods and trends, as well as Sky & department-specific information. the better informed our people are, the better the choices they can make.
                Beyond "Reactive resourcing" -> Building stable capability
                Beyond "Reviewing CVs" -> Identifying talent 
                Beyond "Onboarding" -> A Warm Welcome
                </p><p> 
                From there we listed ‘What are we doing now?’ and then ‘Next Steps’ to create specific tasks to help progress towards achieving these goals.
                 </p><p>
                 
                 
                So lots of this material won’t be relevant to the current department as believe it or not we are more progressive !
                </p><p> 
                You may not have access to these old confluence pages so I have added PDFs of them.

                    <h4>Hardest part of being a manager?</h4>
                    One of the hardest thing to do as a line manager is to manage people who have character / personality things to improve on.
                </p>
                <p>

                    It can be a difficult subject to broach as it can be quite personal. They may not want to acknowledge it and also it could be a long process for someone to change parts of their personality or makeup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two examples of this I have had to deal with have been someone who has
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bhaavna</li>
                            <li>Michael/Will B</li>
                        </ul>
                    It can be a difficult subject to broach as it can be quite personal. They may not want to acknowledge it and also it could be a long process for someone to change parts of their personality or makeup.

                        <h4>CI/CD - Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery</h4>
                        Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. 
                        <img class="ui fluid image" src="./static/images/CI_diag.png">
                        By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

                            <li>Maintain a single source repository</li>
                            <li>(Encourages) frequent commits</li>
                            <li>Automate the build</li>
                            <li>Make your build self-testing</li>
                            <li>Fail fast</li>
                            <li>Every commit should build on an integration machine</li>
                            <li>Safe rollback option</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Continuous Deployment</h4>
                        Continuous Deployment is closely related to Continuous Integration and refers to the release into production of software that passes the automated tests - Essentially, it is the practice of releasing every good build to users, ideally multiple times a day.

                    <h5>Before:</h5>
                    <p>Before we learned how to do it properly we split into groups and made an attempt to come up with diagrams of a system. In our case we focussed on the ADI Builder as part of Messenger.</p>

                    <p>After learning some tips about the C4 model:</p>

                    </div>
                    <h5>Results/Conclusions:</h5>
                    <p>The results were much better! We took an action to create C4 diagrams for applications within the department. We ended up with consistent diagrams that everyone could understand and reason about. We then used these diagrams to illustrate proposed architectural changes through projects or rework. It proved extremely useful for example in refactoring some of the applications, helping us decide how to separate & group things more logically.</p>
