                    <p></p><p>One of the more difficult things I have had to do in my career is to make the transition into a managerial/team lead role. One of the main reason's people leave a company is because of their line manager, so it's clear not everyone gets it right.</p>
                    <h4>Why is it hard you ask? </h4>
                    <p>Mainly because it involves people! And everyone is different. No two people are the same. People react differently to different situations. So, there are always new challenges to navigate but it keeps it interesting! </p>
                    <h4>How did I learn?</h4>
                    <p>Most of it is by learning the hard way - learning by experience. Doing it the wrong way, recognising that and then learning from it.</p>
                    <p>The three hardest things to learn are:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Delegation</li>
                            <li>Line management for your team members</li>
                            <li>Taking the company line</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Delegation</h4>
                    <p>Quite often the reason you were chosen to be a manager is because of the good work you did as an individual to that point. You probably went over and above on a project or were the go to person etc. So now that you are a manager you are more than likely to carry on like that. I have seen this pretty much every time some makes the transition. If you continue to do this, first of all you'll get burnt out quickly, you'll be a bottleneck for the team but even worse you'll be a bad manager! You won't progress your team members by exposing them to the tasks/situations they need to experience to progress their own skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>For those reasons, you need to delegate. But it's not just about delegation. You could still fall into the trap of being too involved and you'll end up micro managing your team members. This is probably worse than just doing the tasks yourself. Because now the person you are micro managing is going to feel controlled and not at all empowered. This can be quite demotivating. </p>
                    <p>To delegate properly you need to have trust in the people you are delegating to. It's hard to farm off a task you are responsible for to someone else but you have to do it. If they succeed, great. If they fail, it's not ideal but they'll learn so much through that and once they learn from it, adjust and are able to do that task going forward, that's one more thing off your list, giving you more time to spin all the other plates you have as a manager/team lead. 
                    </p>
                    <p>As a result of this not only will you have eased your work load, for your team member they will now feel more empowered, may have learnt a new skill and it might be another feather in their bow needed for their career progression. So, this brings us nicely onto line management ...</p>
                    <h4>Line Management</h4>
                    <p>A big part of line management is being responsible for people's progression in their skills and in their careers. If you care about this and help them progress, they will be happier, more motivated, more productive and will contribute to a better output for the team as a whole.</p>
                    <p>An old phrase 'Treat everyone like you would like to be treated' is not something you should follow when you are a line manager. Everyone is different and people are motivated by different things. What motivates you may not be the same thing that motivates the next person. Some people are just in it for the money and that is a clear motivation for them, more want to progress up the ladder quickly, others want recognition, some like getting constructive feedback on areas they need to improve on. One big one that applies to a lot of people is 'Mastery' - excelling or becoming more knowledgeable in a particular skill. Constantly learning on the job will keep things fresh for them and will be a big motivation for many.</p>
                    <p> For someone who is motivated in this way the worst thing you can do to them is keep them doing the same thing on a team, you have to challenge them to learn new things, take on new skills or give them different types of work. If they end up doing the same thing over and over they will get demotivated and leave. Sometimes as a manager of a team you have to recognise if there are no opportunities in your team for them, the best thing you can do as a manager is let them move to a different team. It's not ideal for the current team but better on the whole for the company to keep them allowing them to further their career and skillset.</p>

                    <h4>Appraisals</h4>
                    <p>Having annual or six-monthly appraisals are important. They allow you to set some clear objectives for the employee and allow you both to measure them against those objectives. It should be a joint effort by you and the person you are managing to come up with these objectives. Some of those objectives can be about progressing the skills they want to master or ones that are needed to merit a promotion. Ideally these should be <a href="https://www.professionalacademy.com/blogs-and-advice/what-are-smart-objectives-and-how-do-i-apply-them" >S.M.A.R.T </a> objectives. </p>

                    <p>However, it's not enough to have just once or twice-yearly meetings on this. Yes, that cadence is fine for the formal appraisals but you should be meeting your team member much more regularly than that to touch base with them, discuss any issues they have, give feedback to them and talk about the longer-term objectives and progress on those with them. This is particularly important if there are issues to be addressed. It's best to raise these with them early, explain what the issue is and why it is impacting the team/company and how they need to change to improve. The worst thing you can do is rock up at someone's annual appraisal and let them know of an issue you have been having with them. It may be a surprise to them and they may feel ambushed and rightly ask why this is the first they have been hearing about it. </p>

                    <p>You are better off being transparent with them, address the issue from the start and give them a chance to correct it with some objectives of what you are expecting from them. The ball is now in their court. Most people will try and improve and worst case if they don't at least you have some objectives to measure against if things need to be taken further later on. Having salary discussions around increases (or not as the case may be) can be difficult conversations to have. That's why you need to communicate it correctly, have the ground work done throughout the year to help justify decisions etc. Nothing should be a surprise in these end of year meetings.</p>

                    <h4> Balanced Team</h4>
                    <p>Another aspect of team leading is building a balanced team. Too many seniors may lead to clashes of egos, difficulty in reaching consensus or people getting bored having to pick up more menial tasks. Having too many juniors might lead to mistakes due to inexperience. You want the right mix of junior, mid-level and seniors in the team. You want the seniors to lead by example, guide the team technically and pass on their experience to the more junior team members. The juniors are there to learn the ropes. Pairing seniors with juniors too much will make the juniors feel overwhelmed and the seniors will be bored of going too slowly. This is where the mid-level guys gel the team together. They will learn from the seniors but will be able to coach the more junior members on the things they have recently learned themselves. One of the best ways of understanding something in depth is to be able to teach someone else it. In this scenario, everyone learns!</p>

                    <h4>Taking the company line</h4>
                    <p>Being a team member is different to leading a team. When you are a team member you can gripe to your fellow team members about your manager or company etc. A lot of this might just be letting off steam but some of these gripes will be real. However now that you are a manager you now need to take the company line on issues. Usually the company has valid reasons for making certain decisions and how these are communicated by you will have a big impact on the team member or the morale of the team as a whole. You need to be able to present the company point of view and explain how these decisions were arrived at. It's best to be transparent as much as possible.</p>

                    <h4>Clear Direction - The What and the Why</h4>
                    Everyone works best when they know exactly what they have to do. Presenting a clear direction to the team and letting them get on with it, will help the team have a clear purpose and be more efficient in achieving these goals. Usually this needs to come from above on the company direction/strategy or a project/delivery goal. Everyone is more bought into what they are doing if they know what exactly is it they are trying to build and why they are building it.</p>

                    <h4>Future Proofing the team</h4>
                    <p>As a manager, you always need to plan ahead. You need to think about all eventualities and people leaving the company is always going to happen. That's why you need to be ready for it. Developing your team member's skills and working with them towards promotion will help you in the long term with your succession planning. Pairing is a good way of making sure the knowledge is spread and no one on the team is indispensable. Also, a good way to future proof the team is to continue to recruit juniors, train them up and by the time they are ready to progress to mid-level, the mid-level guys might be ready to step up to Senior. The Seniors can move on to other teams to keep things fresh. As a manager, you need to work with the other managers in the company and see what employees needs to learn certain skills, see what opportunities exist in other teams if they don't in yours and move people around to get more exposure and to keep things fresh and to keep all the teams balanced.</p>

                    <h4>Culture</h4>
                    Hopefully you will be part of a company with a good culture and then as a manager you need to ensure the team are following the same cultural philosophies. If not and if you can't control the company culture then at least you can influence the team's culture. You can define 'ways of working norms' for the team so everyone is on the same page as to how the team works. You can mix things up in retrospectives with ice breakers. You can create a bit of fun by getting the team involved in social activities - nights out, team lunches, five a side football etc. All these things help foster a good team culture that team members want to be part of and will be happier and more productive because of it.

                    <h4>Managing Managers</h4>
                    <p>If you reach 'Zen' level management you'll become a manager of managers. You'll be responsible for these managers and their teams also. If you are details person who likes being very hands on, then it's harder again as you are one level removed from the nitty gritty. So that trust I mentioned earlier is even more important now.</p>
                    <p>
                    Being a manager of a manager means you also become more of coach or mentor for them, in particular if they are new to the role. You'll essentially be guiding them through all the situations I mentioned above that you have experienced yourself previously as they come across similar ones. You'll need to get them to delegate and also get them to care about their employee's careers. But, there will always be new different situations to deal with, so you will also learn from it - every day is a school day!

                <h3 class="ui header">Situation:</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the teams I took over had very low morale. This due to lots of reasons, here are some of them:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disgruntled employees unhappy with previous line manager and last set of annual appraisals</li>
                        <li>Was told by the previous manager in the handover that a few people were likely to leave soon</li>
                        <li>Too Much Support work and not enough new engineering / development</li>
                        <li>Architects Silo - handed off projects late in the decision-making process</li>
                        <li>High ratio of contractors to permanent staff in the team</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3 class="ui header">Task:</h3>
                <p>Try and keep the team together and motivated, stable and avoid having too much of a brain drain at the same time. All while delivering important projects for the company.</p>

                <h3 class="ui header">What did I do?</h3>
                <p>Here are some of the things that I did to try and improve the situation. Most of it is probably common sense but for some reason it wasn't done previously. Lots of simple changes had an overall positive impact.</p>

                <h3>Line management</h3>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Held more regular one to ones</li>
                    <li>Gave everyone a blank slate, whatever issues individuals had with previous manager would be put to one side (he said / she said), would be judged on what I saw of them from that point on</li>
                    <li>Over first few months tried to get to know the team members and what motivated them</li>
                    <li>Some wanted more money, some wanted more interesting work, some wanted more feedback in 1 on 1's</li>
                    <li>Told them we can only control the controllables, what do we have control of within the team to change</li>
                    <li>Focus on individuals and their career progression. Set goals for people to achieve within the team and if they succeeded in those then they would warrant good appraisals and from there may come good financial reward or promotion etc. depending on budget. Also set technical goals for areas to improve on with a long-term aim of promotion to next level. </li>
                    <li>Succession planning: recruit more permanent staff with a longer-term goal of training them up and having them in place if people were to leave over time.</li>
                    <li>Let go of some long-standing contractors.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Team happier that more focus was put on them as individuals, their concerns and their career progression</li>
                    <li>Team morale improved</li>
                    <li>Peoples Objectives set and also where appropriate aligned with team delivery gave clearer focus on what they had to do to progress</li>
                    <li>Contractors leaving helped give more ownership and responsibility to the permanent employees and allowed room for some of them to step up and fill the knowledge, experience and leadership void by those who left. This extra exposure helped them take steps forwards in their career progression where some of them were promoted to Senior Developers for example</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Support</h3>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduced Support Rota & new support process with priority being paramount</li>
                    <li>Setup Kanban JIRA project for other teams to raise tickets and have visibility of them and what they are competing against in terms of priorities</li>
                    <li>Support Tool created to better track the status of assets</li>
                    <li>Team took feedback from support users and other teams on requirements to improve this app</li>
                    <li>Put a tax on new projects to allow money and time to be spent on this new support process</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A well-defined support process for other teams to follow, rather than the adhoc methods used before</li>
                    <li>Less context switching between support admin, checking email, and doing feature work. Pair dedicated to support each day. Rest of team could concentrate on the feature work.</li>
                    <li>Better team efficiency as a result</li>
                    <li>Priority support items were addressed in an appropriate time frame</li>
                    <li>More visibility and better comms around where support issues were at, therefore reduced emails and chasing from other teams</li>
                    <li>Happier team</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Architecture</h3>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Actions:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weekly Architects meetings to discuss questions on current work and also an introduction to upcoming projects or changes, that the team could feed ideas back for</li>
                    <li>Team took control of the architectural tools /documentation (API definitions, descriptions on the mappings of outputs to the inputs) for their team and application</li>

                <p></p>
                <p>For a while now I've been thinking about getting back into coding as a bit of a hobby. This was triggered in work recently while helping out triaging issues in the run-up to a project go live. I ran some sql queries and grepped some logs on a Docker container. It was nothing crazy but it reminded me that I enjoyed this when I was a developer - understanding a system and getting to the route of a problem.
                </p>
                <p>So, I decided I wanted to create something. But where to start? There are so many new languages to use now like, Python, Java 12, Node etc. Also, it's no longer just about languages. There are many new frameworks & tools used to write, build, test, configure and deploy an application. Even version control has moved on. Git is widely used now whereas 'back in my day' CVS or SVN were used. I realise as I write this how old this is making me sound.
                </p>
                <p> Which front-end frameworks to pick? Angular v React for example. I had so much to learn. Where would I find time to do any of this in between having a family with 3 kids, work and planning our return back to Ireland. To be honest it became a bit overwhelming and I got stuck in a state of stagnation and not doing anything at all.
                </p>
                <p> Eventually I got a grip of myself and after a new "Get into Technology" apprentice joined our team, it made me realise how much I actually do know. Yes, I haven't used all the latest and greatest modern technologies that all the developers on my last few teams use but I do have a good solid background in building working software solutions so I just need to work on reskilling myself in the languages and frameworks that are used these days. As well as this, there have never been as much resources on the internet and courses on pluralsight etc. to use. So, there are no excuses really.
                </p>
                <p>I decided to approach it like I approach large projects or difficult tasks at work. Don’t try to eat the elephant all at once, break it down and eat one bite at a time. This was the same message I was telling the apprentice while coaching her up and trying to re-assure her that yes there was a lot to learn but just to take it one step at a time. I chose to practice what I preached and applied it to myself also. I am going to set some basic goals, pick a project, start simple and iterate from there. Along the way we can layer in different tools as we go to add to the learning. Some of the ideas I had in my head for a project:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Create a nice interactive website</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Write some python to pull information from Strava using its APIs and create my own custom front end to display that stats and figures I wanted with some pretty graphs</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Use a NoSQL DB like Couchbase, Mongo etc.</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Learn an OO programming using Java</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Do something with a raspberry pie</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Write a mobile app - Android or iOS</div>
                    </div>
                I decided to go with a Website. I needed to update my CV anyway for applying for job applications for my move to Cork so why not create a website to host this information and potentially display this info a bit nicer than a traditional CV would. Plus having a defined goal will help focus on that for building something.
                </p><p>
                Rather than jumping straight into a JavaScript framework and hooking it up to a DB, let’s start with building a static website. Doing this will help get back into simple HTML, CSS and some JS as well as getting used to GIT as version control (I used CVS). Once that is done we can expand into something more elaborate. So that's the plan. Let's see how it works out ...

                <p></p>
                <p>Today I explored Semantic UI. It’s exactly the type of thing I had been looking for. A nice boot strapped CSS with a simple consistent and clean look and feel to it out of the box.
                <p>Importantly it has really good <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html">documentation with sample usage</a>. To start off you simply need to include the relevant semantic CSS and JS files into your page. There is some JQuery code you can use as well to bring the CSS attributes to life via JS to show how to use them. </p>
                <p>A 60 min intro tutorial on <a href="ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9mUH1EWp40">YouTube</a></p>
                <p> To run you’d need to:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Npm to install semantic UI</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Gulp to  build and compile code to create local semantic CSS and JS files</div>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>In the demo, he sourced versions of these files from cloud CDNs and then later he built the compiled code later to create the local files. </p>
                <p>Once you install semantic, then you can overwrite the default themes if you wish for certain attributes. It looks good on a mobile also.</p>
                <p>I will now be using it on this site, you'll be able to see for yourself the results!</p>

                    <h3>Results/Conclusions:</h3>
                    <p>The results were much better! We took an action to create C4 diagrams for applications within the department. We ended up with consistent diagrams that everyone could understand and reason about. We then used these diagrams to illustrate proposed architectural changes through projects or rework. It proved extremely useful for example in refactoring some of the applications, helping us decide how to separate & group things more logically.</p>
