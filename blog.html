                <p> OpenBet did some pretty cool stuff but a big drawback was the company stuck with the same tools it always used and very rarely adopted some new technologies being used. </p>   
                <p>We kept reinventing the wheel when we could have used off the shelf open source products that had already been built and had solved the common problems and already overcome all the teething issues that arose with building something from scratch. Some examples would be:

                    <div role="listitem" class="item">Caching data layer (called SiteServer) rather than using something like memcahced</div>
                    <div role="listitem" class="item">Adopting CI/CD</div>
                    <div role="listitem" class="item">Focussing on simple front end development and keeping developing for mobile high on the agenda</div>
                    <div role="listitem" class="item">Having key products as a service rather than bespoke development for every customer</div>
                </div>
                <p> These are just some of the examples. It led to the company losing its ground as the market leader and projects taking longer to develop than they could have. But for the developers in the company it meant that nothing new from a technology standpoint was learned.  Because we were a ‘Time & Materials’ company we didn’t get given the time for experimentation/learning/R&D and had to focus on billable hours. People got bored of doing the same thing over and over. Some people left, some people move into more managerial positions (like me). But on the whole people didn’t progress their breadth of technology tools while there. Having moved to Sky where there is much more diverse

                <p>There are so many frameworks/languages/frameworks/tools to use now. As well as this there were so many things I had in my head I wanted to do. Just some of the ideas:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Create a nice interactive website</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Write some python to pull information from Strava using it’s APIs and create my own custom front end to display that stats and figures I wanted with some pretty graphs</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Learn an OO programming using Java</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Do something with a raspberry pie</div>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p> But where to start? Which frameworks to pick? Angular v React for example. I had so much to learn. Where would I find time to do any of this in between having a family with 3 kids, work and planning our return back to Ireland. To be honest it became a bit overwhelming and i got stuck in a state of stagnation and not doing anything at all. 
                </p>
                <p> Eventually I got a grip of myself and decided to approach it like I approach large projects or difficult tasks at work. Don’t try to eat the elephant all at once, do it one bite at a time. So i decided to set some basic goals and iterate from there. Rather than jumping straight into a Javascript framework and hooking it up to a DB, let’s start with building a static website. Doing this will help get back into simple HTML, CSS and some JS as well as getting used to GIT as version control (I used CVS). Once that is done we can expand into something more elaborate.

                <p>Today I discovered Semantic UI. It’s exactly the type of thing I had been looking for. A nice boot strapped CSS with a simple consistent and clean look and feel to it out of the box. 
                <p>Importantly it has really good <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html.">documentation with sample usage</a>. To start off you simply need to include the relevant semantic CSS and JS files into your page. There is some JQuery code you can use as well to bring the css attributes to life via JS to show how to use them. </p>
                <p>A 60 min intro tutorial on <a href="ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9mUH1EWp40">youtube</a></p>
                <p> To run you’d need to:
                    <div role="list" class="ui bulleted list achievements">
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Npm to install semantic UI</div>
                        <div role="listitem" class="item">Gulp to  build and compile code to create local semantic CSS and JS files</div>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>In the demo he sourced versions of these files from cloud CDNs and then later he built the compiled code later to create the local files. </p>
                <p>Once you install semantic, then you can overwrite the default themes if you wish for certain attributes. </p>
