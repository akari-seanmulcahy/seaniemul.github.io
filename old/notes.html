                <h4 class="ui red header">Situation:</h4>
                <p>An old school developer in attitude and skill set, who had a bad reputation competency wise, and from a work ethic point of view, mainly because of the group she hung out with. She was perceived to have been hanging off the coat tails of others and it wasn't clear what her contribution was or if she was a competent developer or not.
                </p>
                <h4 class="ui yellow header">Task:</h4>
                <p>Try and improver he skills and also decide if she was someone we wanted to keep in the team / company.</p>
                <h4 class="ui blue header">Action:</h4>
                <p>I gave her a fresh start on a new team that we formed. The team ways of working, was going to be more agile and modern than where she had come from. There was a graduate on this team who had a great attitude and work ethic, although she was young, Ellen set a good example for people like her to realise they had no excuses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                She clearly had to improve her development skills. In 1-1's she acknowledged this and we came up with objectives for her to improve her coding. It was clear from talking to her that she lacked confidence. We came up with ways she could contribute to the new team outside of coding. She had the most domain knowledge and she could step up and take more ownerships of task.  </p>
                <p>
                <h4 class="ui green header">Results:</h4>
                She started to embrace the news ways of working. She had the domain knowledge and was able to help get the team get up to speed and also help break down the tasks from an analysis stand point She also took ownership of her tasks and started to deliver. Over time by pairing with the stronger developers in the team she started to improve her coding. Since then she has been seen to taking the lead on the teams she has been on since.

                    <h4>Hardest part of being a manager?</h4>
                    One of the hardest thing to do as a line manager is to manage people who have character / personality things to improve on.
                </p>
                <p>

                    It can be a difficult subject to broach as it can be quite personal. They may not want to acknowledge it and also it could be a long process for someone to change parts of their personality or makeup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two examples of this I have had to deal with have been someone who has
                        <ul>

                    <h4>Extreme Programming</h4>
===================
https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/
https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'xp))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)
===================
The method prescribes a small number of absolutely essential practices and encourages teams to perform those practices as good as they possibly can, almost to the extreme. 
 - communication
 - simplicity
 - feedback
 - respect
 - courage
===================
- Team who work closely together with the customer representitive
- Focused on business value, the team produces the software in a series of small fully-integrated releases (CI) that pass all the tests the Customer has defined.
- Extreme Programmers work together in pairs and as a group, with simple design and obsessively tested code, improving the design continually to keep it always just right for the current needs
- team keeps the system integrated and running and use small releases of working and tested code to do this
- entire team is responsible for the code, it's quality and standards are consistent. Design is simple and understood by all
- pair programming and test driven development are used for good programming (2 sets of eyes and lots of swapping) for learning and tests are for early feedback
- planning
    - release planning - Initial Bigger picture plan (with customer) is revised regularly by the team (keeps context of the bigger picture with the samller iterations)
    - iteration - sprints planned based on prev velocity
    - progress is always visible and nothing is every 90% done (it's either done or it is not)
    - sustainable pace (don't burn out), it's more productive this way
    - Incremental Design - design improvement is done as you go - refactoring (along with associated tests)  - Extreme Programming focuses on delivering business value in every iteration. To accomplish this over the course of the whole project, the software must be well-designed. The alternative would be to slow down and ultimately get stuck.

<h4>Lean</h4>
- https://www.planview.com/resources/articles/what-is-lean/
- The two pillars of Lean are continuous improvement and respect for people. 
- Cont Improvement
    - Lean focuses on adding value, rather than removing waste - focusing only on value-adding activities,
    - Identify (something to improve upon), plan (on how to improve it), implement, review
    - autonomy, mastery, purpose

                        <h4>CI/CD - Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery</h4>
                        Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. 
                        <img class="ui fluid image" src="./../static/images/CI_diag.png">
                        By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

                            <li>Make your build self-testing</li>
                            <li>Fail fast</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Continuous Deployment</h4>
                        Continuous Deployment is closely related to Continuous Integration and refers to the release into production of software that passes the automated tests - Essentially, it is the practice of releasing every good build to users, ideally multiple times a day.

                <p>How do you make culture and attitude change at a department level? </p>
                <p>A few years ago we started this process in the department I was in. It was an old school mentality department with more of a waterfall non agile mind-set by the people running it and also from the developers on the ground. Releases were 'Big Bang' project releases every quarter (at best), which had major months long test phases running up to them. Small but important changes or simple bug fixes got held up and had to wait on the release train. A lot of the time these changes not only didn't make it into the next release but the release after that, as code was locked down for this rigorous manually testing phase. Even still most releases had serious bugs in them. Multiple major branches had to be maintained and merging was big ordeal because of all this causing more bugs as this happened after all the testing on the project branch.</p>
                <p>Work was siloed and the development teams only cared about the project they were working on. A dedicated support team managed support of the production system. The did lots of fire fighting and quenched lots of fires. It was a bit of a hero mentality. Because of the silo the development team weren't involved in investigating root cause for these production issues, most of them didn't even have access to production. Because of this environment developers never learned from these prod incidents and instead of engineering an application to avoid pitfalls learned from previous experiences or issues the same basic issues cropped up over and over again. A simple example of this was that data changes would constantly be applied on production rather than fixing </p>
                <p><ul>
                <li> Siloed work between dev and support</li>
                <li> support heroes quenching fires rather than the teams building the apps stopping the fires happening in the first place</li>
                <li> no real agile culture, monolith application</li>
                <li> lots of contracts v permies, people who have seen people try to make changes / transform change before and failed and are resistant</li>
                <li> use some projects as example projects to show how changes can be releases faster</li>
                </ul>      </p>
                                <p>resistance to change - get a key group to drive the change and identify people within the teams who will help to get the teams to adopt the changes. </p>
                                <p>Results: Teams assigned ownership of applications.
                                Takes time, long game 
                                </p>
                <p>Kind of similar process to defining Department Values. For buy-in you’d need a lot of people to buy into it and a good way to do that is to involve them in coming up with a process like below. As discussed probably a cross over between some of the below themes and some of the people survey initiatives going on currently.
                 
                </p><p>
                Managed to find the old confluence pages for this. The 2 main ones being:
                http://confluence.bse.intranet.sky:8090/display/WW/Software+Principles
                which was mainly defined by the Tech people
                </p><p> 
                and
                http://confluence.bse.intranet.sky:8090/display/WW/Continuous+Improvement
                with the sub-pages for the following themes:
                <ul>
                <li>People</li>
                <li>Curate - Build the right thing</li>
                <li>Deliver - Build it effectively</li>
                <li>Code - Build the thing right</li>
                <li>Test</li>
                <li>Deploy</li>
                </ul>
                So each of these themes was broken down further by groups of people brainstorming things / behaviours to move From -> To.
                </p><p>
                Here is an example of the people one:
                </p><p>
                <h4>People</h4> 
                We attract the best people and keep them highly engaged and motivated in a challenging and fun environment
                Beyond "Basic job titles" -> Job families & core competencies
                What is job families and core competencies?
                Creating a clear & consistent career progression path, to encourage personal development at Sky. Identifying a framework for people to work against to develop their skills. 
                Beyond "Generic training courses" -> Knowledge improvement
                What is knowledge improvement?
                Increasing the team's knowledge of industry tools, methods and trends, as well as Sky & department-specific information. the better informed our people are, the better the choices they can make.
                Beyond "Reactive resourcing" -> Building stable capability
                Beyond "Reviewing CVs" -> Identifying talent 
                Beyond "Onboarding" -> A Warm Welcome
                </p><p> 
                From there we listed ‘What are we doing now?’ and then ‘Next Steps’ to create specific tasks to help progress towards achieving these goals.
                 </p><p>
                 
                 
                So lots of this material won’t be relevant to the current department as believe it or not we are more progressive !
                </p><p> 
                You may not have access to these old confluence pages so I have added PDFs of them.
