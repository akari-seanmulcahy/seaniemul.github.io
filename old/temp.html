                            <p>I was originally brought into the department I joined Sky with, to help establish a good culture and develop good engineering practices through Agile ways of working. This was done by leading by example and embedding some of the good engineering practices I learned at OpenBet, taking line management and career progression of employees seriously and changing the mind-set of the department to be focussed on building the software for the long term through ownership and by placing a priority in non-functional requirements like supportability, performance etc. and not just short term project deadlines.</p>

                        <p>I was originally brought into the department I joined Sky with, to help establish a good culture and develop good engineering practices through Agile ways of working. This was done by leading by example and embedding some of the good engineering practices I learned at OpenBet, taking line management and career progression of employees seriously and changing the mind-set of the department to be focussed on building the software for the long term through ownership and by placing a priority in non-functional requirements like supportability, performance etc. and not just short term project deadlines.</p>
