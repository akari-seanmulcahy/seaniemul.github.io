<h1 id="developer-assessment-panels-faq">Developer Assessment Panels FAQ</h1>

<p>This document describes the Assessment Panel process and its relationship with the Career Progression Matrix.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is an Assessment Panel?</p>

    <p>An Assessment Panel is a means of assessing the skills of a developer with reference to the skills and competencies
listed on the <a href="index.html">Career Progression Matrix</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the goal of the Assessment Panel process?</p>

    <p>As a means to assist and support career development, its goal is to provide feedback which is:
 - consistent
 - fair
 - honest
 - constructive
 - actionable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is an Assessment Panel the same as a promotion board?</p>

    <p>No. Regardless of the outcome of an Assessment Panel, the candidate is not guaranteed a promotion or salary increase.
Salary increases or promotions must continue to be actioned through the existing HR processes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="career-progression-matrix">Career Progression Matrix</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is the purpose of the Career Progression Matrix?</p>

    <p>The Matrix outlines the competencies expected of a developer in a particular role (e.g. Associate, Developer, Senior)
across a range of relevant skill areas. Its purpose is to be used as the reference point for developer assessments,
with a view to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>determining whether a developer is currently performing at a level commensurate to a particular role</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>being a source of actions which can help a developer progress to a given role</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do I use it?</p>

    <p>Each cell of the matrix specifies a particular level of competence which a developer in a given role is expected to
have reached in each of the technical and non-technical skills listed in the leftmost column. Clicking on a cell will
give examples of behaviours and characteristics which could demonstrate that a developer is performing at that level
in the given skill.</p>

    <p>Please note that the examples are indeed only examples, and there may be other ways in which a developer can
demonstrate a particular level of competence in a given skill.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="for-developers">For Developers</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How do I prepare for my Assessment Panel?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You should provide examples of your work at a code level, and be prepared to discuss it in the Assessment Panel.
You may, for example, make reference to Git pull requests or commits which show your work, but if you can think of
other ways of showing your work effectively, this is acceptable too.</p>

        <p>Your examples should be submitted to the assessors no later than one week before the date of the panel.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You should prepare a 20-minute presentation for the panel, on a topic of your choice which you feel helps you
demonstrate that you have met the skills required of a Senior Developer according to the Career Progression Matrix.
Speak with the Principal Engineers in your department if you require any guidance on a suitable topic to present.
If there are no Principal Engineers in your department, speak to your Manager about arranging guidance.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who will be assessing me?</p>

    <p>A good rule of thumb is that there will be 3 assessors: typically, a Scrum Master, Principal Engineer and Senior
Developer. This may vary depending on the specific circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long is a Panel?</p>

    <p>A Panel typically lasts between 90 minutes and two hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens in the Panel?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>First, you will give your presentation and the assessors will ask questions related to it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Following this, there will be time allotted to questions based on the skills and competencies in the Career
Progression Matrix.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Finally, you will have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have of the assessors.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
